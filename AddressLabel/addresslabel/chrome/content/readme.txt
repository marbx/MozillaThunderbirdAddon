SOMEWHERE IN THE MOZILLA UPLOAD PROCESS?


This is a Thunderbird Add-on, not a Firefox Add-on.

Create address labels from selected contacts in pdf, odt, ps or html.

Usage
1) Open Thunderbird.
2) Chose Add-on settings.
3) In the Address Book, select contacts and right click.
4) Print with "Actual Size" (not "Fit to Page").





About this extension


Addresses are formatted by default as:
. ZIP-code City
. Country

When country is "UK":
. City
. (State/province)
. ZIP-code
. Country

When country is "US", "USA", or "United States":
. City, State ZIP-code
. Country


In the options, you can specify one country to be omitted from being printed.



Background to OpenDocument:
An OpenDocument file either consists of a zip archive or a single XML
document. Both forms are supported by LibreOffice but Microsoft Word only supports zip.
I see a number of advantages to create a single document.
