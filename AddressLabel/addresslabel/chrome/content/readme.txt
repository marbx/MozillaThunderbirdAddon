?WHERE IS THIS--- About this extension ---WHERE IS THIS?


Addresses are formatted as:
. (ZIP/Postal Code) (City)
. [Country]
Except when country is "UK":
. (City)
. (State/province)
. (ZIP/Postal Code)
. [Country]

You can specify one country, probably the country you live in, to be omitted from being printed.



Background to OpenDocument:
An OpenDocument file either consists of a zip archive or a single XML
document. Both forms are supported by LibreOffice but Microsoft Word only supports zip.
I see a number of advantages to create a single document.
